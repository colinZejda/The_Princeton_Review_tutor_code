Grading:

10% - Design â€“ outline proper sequence of steps, calculations (if necessary). Identify values of any known constants (e.g. commission rate). Identify what the user inputs will be and what the output will be.

Design:

Steps: First, get input from user. Next, define constants. Then, perform calculations for output values. Lastly, show results.

Calculations: 

num_papers_per_week = papers_per_day * times_per_week

weekly_salary = num_papers_per_week * cost_per_paper * my_commission

weekly_total = weekly_salary + tips_per_week 



Known constants: cost per paper is $2.45,  and my commission is 8%

User inputs: prompt user to input 3 things: number of papers delivered each day, how many days per week and how much money gained in tips.

Output: print results of calculations: papers delivered per week, weekly salary and total income per week



10% - Completeness of your Test plan (at least three test cases). Include screenshots for each test case.

10% - Documentation - Header and in-line comments. Include documentation for the values you chose as the known constants (hourly rate, commission rate) in your comments as well. Documentation of major steps (from Design outline). 

70% - Program prompts and executes correctly on all test cases. Satisfies all requirements, compiles, effectiveness and neatness, descriptive variables, def main
