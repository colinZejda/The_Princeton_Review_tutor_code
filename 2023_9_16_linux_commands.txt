In /home/<username>/2211/Assignments/Assignment1, create four objects in this directory: two directories called dir0 and dir1 and two files called df0 and df1. Then, in dir0 create a file df0.
Navigate to the directory dir0
Demonstrate you are in /home/<username>/2211/Assignments/Assignment1/dir0
Navigate back to your home directory using a shortcut
Answer the following questions for the use of ls command. Demonstrate your answers by typing the appropriate commands and capture the screen with a screenshot called Q3.png. We assume that you are in directory /home/<username>/2211/Assignments/Assignment1 where <username> is your username.

What option(s) should we use with ls if we want to display permission information?
What option(s) should we add to ls di* to display permission information of dir0 and dir1 but not their contents?
What option(s) should we use to display permission information sorted by modification time, such that the most recently updated file/directory appears last.
What option(s) should we use to display permission information for every file and directory under /home/<username>/2211/Assignments/Assignment1
Answer the following questions for the use of find command. Demonstrate your answers by typing the appropriate commands and capture the screen with a screenshot called Q4.png. We assume that you are in directory /home/<username>/2211/Assignments/Assignment1 where <username> is your username.

What option(s) should we use if we want to display recursively all the directory names?
What option(s) should we use if we want to display recursively all the empty directory names?
What option(s) should we use if we want to display recursively all the files (but not directory) whose name starts with d?
What option(s) should we use if we want to display all the files that have been accessed within the last 48 hours?

"Gimme" question
You will need to choose an editor ("IDE") for the C programs you will write in the labs and assignments. Identify 3 editors you could use for writing C programs and provide a short list of advantages and disadvantages to each.
 


ls -a    # a for all, shows hidden files

ls -l     # l for long, shows permission info

ls -d      # display info only for the directory (but not its contents, 1 level)

ls -t      # sort by modification time

ls -r      # display in reverse



ls -ld di*         # like that

# the line above uses -l and -d (long format, only dir info)

# di* means all directories that start with "di," * is wildcard, matches any string

# di* matches dir0, dir1, diadfhasiufdhkjhs, etc



# problem 3 (block) answers: 

ls -l

ls -ld di*

ls -ltr           

ls -l /home/hpate384/2211/Assignments/Assignment1

-type d - searching for directories only

-type f - searching for files only 

# problem 4 notes

recursion: applies the rule to current directory as well as all subdirectories 

find command: used for walking a file hierarchy

cp: copy the files too



-type - allows u to speicify what ur looking for





Q4 (block) answers:

1) find -type d

2) find -type d -empty

3) find -type f -name "d*"

4) find -type f -atime -2     # 2 for 48 hours
