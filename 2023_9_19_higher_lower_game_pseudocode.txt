# tutor solution
1) prompt user for lower bound
2) prompt user for upper bound
3) ensure lower bound < upper bound
4) generate a random number that is between lower bound and upper bound, call it target
5) loop while user's guesses are too high or too low:
   5.1) ask user to enter number within the bounds
   5.2) if user number < lower OR user number > upper bound, print "ERROR, enter a number within bounds, please" and continue
   5.3) if user number > target
    print "LOWER!"
    continue
   5.4) if user number < target 
    print "HIGHER!"
    continue
   5.5) if user number = target
    print "YOU GOT IT!"
    break
6) end
